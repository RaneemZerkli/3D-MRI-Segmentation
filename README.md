# 3D MRI Segmentation and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning and deep learning techniques to segment and classify 3D MRI images for detecting multiple sclerosis (MS). The model leverages a U-Net architecture to identify small lesions in MRI images accurately, addressing challenges such as bias due to the disparity in lesion size and brain size.

## Features
- Preprocessing of 3D MRI images.
- Implementation of U-Net architecture for segmentation.
- Metrics evaluation for model performance.
- Comprehensive pipeline for medical image analysis.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- nibabel
